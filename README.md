For Udacity's [AI for Trading](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-trading--nd880) Nanodegree.

Topic: Multi-Factor Models.

## Overview
* Implementing a portfolio risk model and five alpha factors from scratch.
* Predicting performance, and then optimizing the portfolio using multiple optimization formulations. 
* The datasets are a set of end-of-day stock prices that comes from Quotemedia, as well as sector data organized by Sharadar.

## Concepts
* Modeling portfolio risk with PCA.
* Using Zipline to code up a full testing pipeline.
* Evaluating alpha factors by the Sharpe ratio, factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, and turnover analysis.
* Optimizing factor weights by using CVXPY to formulate and maximize convex functions that include strict factor constraints and target weighting.
